# Microcontroller Simulator
This is the capstone project of Oluwafunbi Aboderin, Naomi Lui-Hing, and Valerie Mae Figuracion.

We used the gem5 simulator as the base, whcih can be found at https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5
Because we cloned this repository, you will see there is a significant number of contributors, but those to look for are tunjijnr1, naomiluihing and vmfiguracion.
